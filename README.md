## What is BMI?

Body mass index, or BMI, gives an indication of your body size.
BMI is calculated using your weight and height (your weight divided by your height squared). Along with several other factors, like your blood pressure and cholesterol, BMI can help estimate your risk of a heart attack or stroke.

Use this app to check your BMI index and your ideal weight to height.
